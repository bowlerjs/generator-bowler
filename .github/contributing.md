## Report a bug

Before creating an issue, please make sure you have checked the [docs](http://docs.bowler.io).
You should also search the github issue tracker, as someone has probably already encountered your issue.

**Please include an example that reproduces your issue, as it really helps when trying to fix it.**

## Pull requests
Everyone :heart: pull requests!
If you have a feature that you think this tool is lacking, **please** open a pull request, and I will check it out!

## Code style
This tool uses prettier and eslint to conform the code to the prefered codestyle.
It will automatically run eslint and prettier before tests and commits, but I highly recommend that you configure your
editor of choice to automatically run it for you as you are coding.

## Code of conduct
Anyone involved in this tool is expected to apply common sense and etiquette.
And not to disrespect or harass another participant.

Anyone or anything that doesn't follow this might get removed, edited or rejected.
