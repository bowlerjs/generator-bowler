# Bowler

> Bowler is a tool that allows you to easily create and develop GraphQL backends.

## About
This project is under development and not yet ready for prime time.  
   I Started this project because I wanted a simple tool that allows me to quickly bootstrap a node.js codebase,
   and to simplify the process of extending the features of the application. 
   
   ## Getting Started
   ```
   $ npm install -g @bowlerjs/cli      # Install Bowler CLI
   
   $ bowler generate schema            # Generate a new Schema
   $ bowler generate middleware        # Generate a new Middleware
   $ bowler generate provider          # Generate a new provider
   $ bowler help                       # Show all commands
   ```
## Testing
Simply run `npm test` or `yarn test` and all your tests will be run.
